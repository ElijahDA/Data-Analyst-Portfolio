# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#First I determined the avg popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track. 

SELECT
artist_name, track_name, avg(popularity), avg(danceability), avg(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;

#Finally I answered the following questions.

-- Calculate the average popularity for the artists in the Spotify data table. Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, show their name, their average popularity, and label them as a “Top Star” --

With TopStar_CTE AS 
    (Select s.artist_name, avg(s.popularity) as avg_p
        From Spotifydata s
        Group by s.artist_name)
    Select artist_name, avg_p as Average_Popularity, 'Top Star' as Class
        From TopStar_CTE
        Where avg_p>=90
        Order by avg_p desc;

--Alternate way to calculate the average popularity for the artists in the Spotify data table. Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, show their name, their average popularity, and label them as a “Top Star”--

Select artist_name, avg(popularity) as Average_Popularity,
    Case 
        When avg(popularity) >= 90 Then "Top Star"
        Else "Losers" End as Class
From Spotifydata
Group by artist_name
Having Class="Top Star"
Order by Average_Popularity desc;
